# miniRT

## üîÜ Project Overview

miniRT is an introduction to the fascinating world of ray tracing, a rendering technique that produces highly realistic computer-generated images by simulating the physical behavior of light. Unlike traditional rasterization methods used in most real-time graphic engines, ray tracing calculates the path of individual light rays as they interact with objects in a 3D scene.

This project implements a basic ray tracer from scratch using C and the miniLibX library, demonstrating fundamental 3D graphics concepts and mathematical principles. Despite its "mini" designation, it creates impressive visual results by accurately calculating shadows, lighting, and object intersections.

## üéØ Features

### Core Rendering Capabilities
- **Ray Tracing Engine**: Models light paths and calculates intersections with geometric objects
- **Scene Parsing**: Reads and processes scene descriptions from .rt files
- **Window Management**: Fluid window interaction using miniLibX
- **Image Export**: Rendered scenes can be displayed in a window

### Geometric Objects
- **Spheres**: Perfect spherical objects with configurable position and diameter
- **Planes**: Infinite flat surfaces with defined orientation
- **Cylinders**: Cylindrical objects with configurable position, orientation, diameter, and height

### Lighting System
- **Ambient Lighting**: Basic scene illumination to prevent complete darkness
- **Diffuse Reflection**: Light reflection based on surface orientation
- **Hard Shadows**: Objects block light, creating realistic shadow areas

### Transformations
- **Translation**: Move objects, lights, and cameras in 3D space
- **Rotation**: Rotate objects and cameras to change orientation

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Ray Tracing Algorithm

The ray tracing process follows these steps:
1. For each pixel in the output image, cast a ray from the camera
2. Calculate intersections with all objects in the scene
3. Find the closest intersection point
4. Calculate lighting at the intersection point considering:
   - Ambient light contribution
   - Direct light contribution with shadow checks
5. Determine the final color based on object color and lighting

### Mathematical Foundations

The implementation involves several key mathematical concepts:
- **Vector Operations**: Dot product, cross product, normalization
- **Line-Object Intersections**: Analytical solutions for rays intersecting with:
  - Spheres (quadratic equation)
  - Planes (algebraic solution)
  - Cylinders (quadratic equation with constraints)
- **Color Calculation**: RGB color manipulation and light intensity factors

### Scene Description Format

Scenes are defined in .rt files with a specific format:
- **A**: Ambient lighting (ratio and color)
- **C**: Camera (position, orientation, field of view)
- **L**: Light source (position, brightness)
- **sp**: Sphere (center coordinates, diameter, color)
- **pl**: Plane (point, normal vector, color)
- **cy**: Cylinder (center, axis, diameter, height, color)

## üß† Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Ray-Object Intersection

The most complex part of the implementation was calculating ray intersections with various geometric shapes:

- **Spheres**: Used the quadratic formula to find intersection points between a ray and a sphere, checking if the discriminant is positive (indicating a hit)
- **Planes**: Calculated the dot product between the ray direction and plane normal to determine intersections
- **Cylinders**: Implemented a more complex quadratic equation solution that accounts for the limited height of cylinders

### Performance Optimization

Several optimizations were implemented to improve rendering speed:
- **Early Ray Termination**: Stop calculations once an opaque object is hit
- **Bounding Box Checks**: Quick rejection tests before detailed intersection calculations
- **Vector Normalization Caching**: Pre-compute normalized vectors when possible

### Memory Management

Careful memory management practices were followed throughout the implementation:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Proper allocation and freeing of memory for scene objects
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error detection and cleanup to prevent memory leaks
